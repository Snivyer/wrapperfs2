# wrapperfs2
wrapperfs2 is the new version of wrappers.

2024-2-28: I finished the major functions of the wrapperfs. It is running like other file systems and I feel happy.


2024-2-29: I add io static and operations and find performances of the wrapperfs are unsatisfacting. I want to add cache to improve it.

2024-3-1 add location, entries, relation cache and metadata cache.
